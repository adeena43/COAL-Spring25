# Task 01:
## MOV AX 3d
comma is missing
## MOV 23, AX
an immediate value cannot be the destination
## MOV CX, CH
size of the 2 operands does not match
## MOVE AX, 1h
move is undefined(correct is mov)
## ADD 2, CX
an immediate value cannot be the destination
## ADD 3, 6
both the source and destination operands cannot be immediate values simultaneously
## INC AX, 2
inc is a unary operator so it only takes single operand either register, memory operand or an immediate value
